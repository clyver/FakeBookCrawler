# FakeBookCrawler
A web crawler that gathers data from a fake social networking website, provided by NU.

Our high level approach was to create GET and POST functions
with the Python socket library.  Once we had those, we constructed
a number of helper methods that would parse HTML, looking for
flags, cookies, and valid links.  These helpers made it easy
to simply iterate over, and modify, the frontier.

The main challenge we faced was getting every single detail just right
in our requests.  Also, it was a tough design decision to re-open a socket
on every request.  This hurts performance, but is clean and simple.

We tested our crawler by having a test file that tested all the utility methods.
